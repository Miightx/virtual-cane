# virtual-cane
#### University project on a virtual white can for visually impaired people

The project is realised by Evan BOKOBZA, Thibault JEANNOT and Laurent LIN for a master degree project. The aim of the project is to develop a tool to help navigation with obstacles. To do so, a significant isolated part is distribuated, in order that everyone can progress smootly and give regards to the other parts. The creation of the device is divided by three parts: 
 - electronic (arduino and electronic circuit)
 - conception (design and 3d printer)
 - obstacle detection code (python)

The materials used to create the device is:
- Camera OAK-D PRO WIDE (RGBD)
- Arduino MKR 1010
- Linear potentiometer
- Vibrators
- 3D printer
- Button
- Computer

Electronic section:
Before realisation of the set-up, a prototype  is made on tinkercad which we ran the arduino to test the arduino code.
